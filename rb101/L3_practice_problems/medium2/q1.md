Every named entity in Ruby has an `object_id`. This is a unique identifier for that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

In other words, in Ruby, all values are objects...but they are not always the **same object**.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:
```rb
def fun_with_ids
  a_outer = 42
  b_outer = "forty two"
  c_outer = [42]
  d_outer = c_outer[0]

  a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
  b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
  c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
  d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before the block."
  puts

  1.times do
    a_outer_inner_id = a_outer.object_id
    b_outer_inner_id = b_outer.object_id
    c_outer_inner_id = c_outer.object_id
    d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

    puts "a_outer id was #{a_outer_id} before the block and is: #{a_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "b_outer id was #{b_outer_id} before the block and is: #{b_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "c_outer id was #{c_outer_id} before the block and is: #{c_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts "d_outer id was #{d_outer_id} before the block and is: #{d_outer_inner_id} inside the block."
    puts

    a_outer = 22
    b_outer = "thirty three"
    c_outer = [44]
    d_outer = c_outer[0]

    puts "a_outer inside after reassignment is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before and: #{a_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "b_outer inside after reassignment is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before and: #{b_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "c_outer inside after reassignment is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before and: #{c_outer.object_id} after."
    puts "d_outer inside after reassignment is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} before and: #{d_outer.object_id} after."
    puts


    a_inner = a_outer
    b_inner = b_outer
    c_inner = c_outer
    d_inner = c_inner[0]

    a_inner_id = a_inner.object_id
    b_inner_id = b_inner.object_id
    c_inner_id = c_inner.object_id
    d_inner_id = d_inner.object_id

    puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{a_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{b_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{c_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} inside the block (compared to #{d_outer.object_id} for outer)."
    puts
  end

  puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{a_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{b_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{c_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts "d_outer is #{d_outer} with an id of: #{d_outer_id} BEFORE and: #{d_outer.object_id} AFTER the block."
  puts

  puts "a_inner is #{a_inner} with an id of: #{a_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{a_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "b_inner is #{b_inner} with an id of: #{b_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{b_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "c_inner is #{c_inner} with an id of: #{c_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{c_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
  puts "d_inner is #{d_inner} with an id of: #{d_inner_id} INSIDE and: #{d_inner.object_id} AFTER the block." rescue puts "ugh ohhhhh"
end
```

Solution:  
The `_outer_inner_id`s (line 19-22) are the same as the `_outer_id`s. The object id does not change just because we are referencing a local variable in the outer scope from inside a block.

After reassignment inside the block (line 30-33), the object id of the variables are now different from what was stored in `_outer_id`s.

In lines 42-45, we are initializing local variables inside the block -- `_inner` -- and assigning them to `_outer` variables. The object id of `_inner` variables stored in `_inner_id`s are the same as that of `_outer` variables. The object ids stay the same because both variables are aliases pointing to the same object in memory.

Coming out of the block, and into the outer scope, `_outer_id`s before the block is different from the object ids of the `_outer` variables after the block. This is because those variables got reassigned inside the block.

In lines 65-68, we cannot access the `_inner` variables from the outer scope. So it will output the strings in `rescue`.
