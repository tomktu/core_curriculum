Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as arguments and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:
```rb
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
```

Solution:  
This will display `My string looks like this now: "pumpkins"` and `My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]`.  This is because the operation performed on the string does not mutate the caller. String concatenation using `+` returns a new string, and `a_string_param` will point to a different string object after the operation. Thus `my_string` stays unchanged after the method call.

`an_array_param` is still pointing to the same object in memory as `my_array`, and since the operation performed on the array mutates the caller, `my_array` is changed after the method call.
