The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:
```rb
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?
```rb
numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)
```

Solution:  
`numbers.delete_at(1)` deletes the element located at index position 1 and returns the value (in this case `2`). Whereas `numbers.delete(1)` deletes all elements in the array containing the value `1`, and returns the removed item (in this case `1`).

Note both these methods mutate the caller.
