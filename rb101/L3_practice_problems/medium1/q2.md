The result of the following statement will be an error:
```rb
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
```
Why is this and what are two possible ways to fix this?

Solution:  
Because Ruby does not allow implicit conversion of Integer to String.
```rb
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{40 + 2}"
```
