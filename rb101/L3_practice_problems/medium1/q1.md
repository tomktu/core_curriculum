Let's do some "ASCII Art" (a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the days before computers had video screens).

For this practice problem, write a one-line program that creates the following output 10 times, with the subsequent line indented 1 space to the right:
```rb
The Flintstones Rock!
 The Flintstones Rock!
  The Flintstones Rock!
```

Solution:
```rb
10.times {|i| puts 'The Flintstones Rock!'.insert(0, ' ' * i)}
```

LS Solution:
```rb
10.times { |number| puts (" " * number) + "The Flintstones Rock!" }
```
