Consider these two simple methods:
```rb
def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end
```
What would be the return value of the following method invocation?
```rb
bar(foo)
```

Solution:
This will return `true`.

Wrong Answer:
It returns `"no"` because `param == "no"` is evaluated first. Since that evaluates to `false` (`"yes" == "no"`), `"no"` is returned.
