One day Spot was playing with the Munster family's home computer and he wrote a small program to mess with their demographic data:
```rb
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end
```
After writing this method, he typed the following...and before Grandpa could stop him, he hit the Enter key with his tail:
```rb
mess_with_demographics(munsters)
```
Did the family's data get ransacked? Why or why not?

Solution:
Yes this messed up the `munsters` hash. Because `Hash#values` method returns an array of the values from the hash. In our case, each value of `munsters` is a nested hash. I assume that the `Hash#values` method returns the same object in memory when the value in a hash is a mutable object.

Also, in terms of object passing, `demo_hash` is pointing to the same object in memory and is an alias to `munsters`.
