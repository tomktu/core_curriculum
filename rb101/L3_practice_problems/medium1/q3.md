Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number:
```rb
def factors(number)
  divisor = number
  factors = []
  begin
    factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
    divisor -= 1
  end until divisor == 0
  factors
end
```
Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is `0`, or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you make this work without using `begin`/`end`/`until`? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

Bonus 1: What is the purpose of the `number % divisor == 0` ?

Bonus 2: What is the purpose of the second-to-last line (`line 8`) in the method (the `factors` before the method's `end`)?

Solution:
```rb
def factors(number)
  factors = []
  divisor = number

  loop do
    break if divisor <= 0

    factors << divisor if number % divisor == 0

    divisor -= 1
  end

  factors
end


# LS solution is to use a while condition

while divisor > 0 do
  factors << number / divisor if number % divisor == 0
  divisor -= 1
end
```
The purpose of `number % divisor == 0` is to check whether the divisor is a factor of the number. If the number can be fully divisible by the divisor, then it is a factor.

The second last line in the method is an implicit return. Once the function retrieves all the factors of the number, we are returning the `factors` array.
