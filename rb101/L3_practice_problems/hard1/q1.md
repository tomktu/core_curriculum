What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?
```rb
if false
  greeting = “hello world”
end

greeting
```

Solution:  
The `greeting` variable will return `nil`.  Since the `if` statement does not create a new scope, we are able to access the variable. However, because the code inside the conditional was not executed due to the condition being `false`, `greeting` was not assigned a value.

LS Solution:  
`greeting` is `nil` here, and no "undefined method or local variable" exception is thrown. Typically, when you reference an uninitialized variable, Ruby will raise an exception, stating that it’s undefined. However, when you initialize a local variable within an `if` block, even if that `if` block doesn’t get executed, the local variable is initialized to `nil`.
