What is the result of the last line in the code below?
```rb
greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings
```

Solution:  
`greetings` will be `{a: 'hi there'}`. This is because strings are mutable in Ruby. `informal_greeting = greetings[:a]` points `informal_greeting` to the same object in memory as the value in the hash. Lastly, when using `<<` operator, it mutates the original string object.
