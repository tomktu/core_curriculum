In this hash of people and their age,
```rb
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }
```
see if "Spot" is present.  
Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this solution?

Solution:
```rb
ages.has_key?("Spot")
# or
ages.include?("Spot")
# or
ages.key?("Spot")

```
