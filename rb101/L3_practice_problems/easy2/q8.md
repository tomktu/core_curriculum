Shorten this sentence:
```rb
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
```
...remove everything starting from "house".

Review the [String#slice!](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-slice-21) documentation, and use that method to make the return value `"Few things in life are as important as "`. But leave the `advice` variable as `"house training your pet dinosaur."`.

As a bonus, what happens if you use the [String#slice](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-slice) method instead?

Solution:
```rb
advice.slice!(advice.index('house')..-1)

advice.slice!(0..advice.index(' house'))
```
Using `String#slice` is not destructive so it will return the sliced portion of the string but the original string is unchanged.
