In the previous practice problem we added Dino to our array like this:
```rb
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flintstones << "Dino"
```
We could have used either `Array#concat` or `Array#push` to add Dino to the family. How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)

Solution:
Can add multiple items to the array by adding the items one at a time using `<<`. Or since `Array#push` returns the array itself, you can chain several appends together using that method. If those multiple items are in a separate array, can use the `Array#concat`  method to concatenate two arrays together.
```rb
flintstones.push('Dino').push('Hoppy')

flintstones.concat(%w(Dino Hoppy))
```
